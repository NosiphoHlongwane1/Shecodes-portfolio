    <p class="about-me-text">
        I have taken a leap of faith that started my web development with the SheCodes bootcamp, and have since completed 9 course, thus frameworks,
        I am eager to grow and expand in the tech industry. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API integration, 
        I have refined my skills through hands-on projects and coursework. 
        My passion for design and user experience drives me to create interactive, visually appealing web applications. 
        Through collaborative projects, I have gained practical experience working with popular front-end frameworks like React & Bootstrap.
